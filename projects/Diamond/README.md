# Diamond Pattern Project

## Introduction
The Diamond Pattern is a design pattern used in smart contract development that allows for flexible and modular contract design. This project implements the Diamond Pattern using Solidity and provides a set of tools for deploying and interacting with the contracts.

## How to Run the Project
1. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
2. **Set Environment Variables**: Ensure you have the necessary environment variables set, such as `PRIVATE_KEY_NILE`.

3. **Deploy the Contracts**: Use the following command to deploy the contracts:
   ```bash
   yarn run migrate --network nile
   ```

## Available Commands
- **Deploy Contracts**: `yarn run migrate`
- **Run Tests**: `yarn run test`

## Overview
The Diamond Pattern allows for multiple facets (contract implementations) to be combined into a single contract. Each facet can implement specific functionalities, making it easier to manage and upgrade contracts.

For more details on each facet, refer to the individual files in the `contracts/facets` directory.

## Contracts Overview
This project includes various smart contracts that implement the Diamond Pattern. Each contract represents a facet that can be added to the diamond, providing specific functionalities. The contracts are modular, allowing for easy upgrades and maintenance.
